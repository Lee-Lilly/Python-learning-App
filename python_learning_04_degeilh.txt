Python learning application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for python learning.

Title: Nutrition App

python_learning_04 covered topics:
	1. List Comprehension
	2. Simple Statistics of list

python_learning_04 implementation:
	1. Based on "food_bank" list obtained from user input (see version 3)
	2. Loop through "food_bank" list, extract 'Fat(g)' and 'Energy(kcal)' values.
	3. Generate two lists of data: fat_index , energy_index
	4. Calculate minum, maxmum and total of all values in the lists.
		
python_learning_03 remarks:	
	
	1. Modified named parameter "nutrition_panel" to "nutrition".
	2. For User input, the keys are added with quantity measures.
	3. print string concatenation of float value must be "str(float_value)"
