Python learning application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for python learning.

Title: Nutrition App

python_learning_05_6 covered topics:
	
	1. Adding new key-value pairs
	2. Accessing values of certain key
	3. Looping through a dictionary
	4. Nesting- A list of dictionaries
	5. Sorting a list of dictionaries by certain values as comparators
	
python_learning_05_6 implementation:
	
	1. Define a usr input function, where data can added to an empty dictionary.
	2. Add new key-value pairs to initial dictionary
	3. Attained dictionary is added to "food_bank" list as food items.
	4. Loop through a list of dictionaries, print all food items {key: value}
	5. Sort "food_bank" list by comparing certain values in dictionary, using itemgetter(keys).	
		
python_learning_05_6 remarks:	
	
	1. Removed class "Food", all operations are on dictionary.
	2. Imported module itemgetter from operator
