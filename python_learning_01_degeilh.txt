Python learning application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for python learning.

Title: Nutrition App

python_learning_01 covered topics:
	1. Variables and Strings 
	2. List
	3. Dictionary

python_learning_01 implementation:
	1. variable: title
	
	2. list: category (food category)
	3. list: food_list (food items)
	
	4. dictionary: food (name, category, nutrition_panel)
	5. dictionary: nutrition_panel (energy, protein, fat, carbonhydrate, etc.)
	6. nested dictionary (food: {nutrition_panel:{...}})
	
	7. Loop through list, access food['name'], food['nutrition_panel]
	8. Loop through list, access key, value pair generated by dict_items()
	
python_learning_01 questions:
	
	1. Why "food.name" not working, but no syntatic error is reported?
	
	2. Why print(food['name'] + ":" + food['nutrition_panel']), report error saying that string concatenation does not apply for dict, while print(food['nutrition_panel']) does print out dict as string.
