Python learning application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for python learning.

Title: Nutrition App

python_learning_02 covered topics:
	1. Class
	2. Function
	3. User input

python_learning_02 implementation:
	1. Class "Food" (constructor with named parameters)
	2. Define Class representation format (instance print out format)
	
	3. Function: input_data (get food data from user input)
	4. Return from input_data (name, category, nutrition_panel)
	
	5. Construct nutrition_panel dictionary by user input (key/value pair) 
	6. Print out class instance
	
python_learning_02 remarks:
	
	1. Now "food.name" is working, because 'food' is an instance of Class.
	Instead, "food['name']" is not subscriptable.
